# SortTime Program
--------
Takes a number from input and grabs that many words from the [text file](manywords100k.txt). Program then sorts those words alphebetically and prints how long it took. Includes an [Excel spreadsheet](Java%20Results.xlsx") with a graph for various numbers and the time it took.

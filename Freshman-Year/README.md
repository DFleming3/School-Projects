## All programming projects that I have worked on during my Freshman year of college

## [Etudes](Etudes) - Program that calculates basic math problems including average, standard deviation, standard deviation of negative numbers or standard deviation of successive numbers. Numbers are gathered randomly in 3 different size options.
## [Fraction App](FractionApp) - This program creates different types of Fractions and displays them.
## [Letter](Letter) - This program creates a sample letter and includes a tongue-in-cheek joke regarding programming terms and their usage.
## [OrderIt](OrderIt) - This program randomly orders an array of inputted words.
## [Salut](Salut) - Prints "Salut Mundi" followed by a pattern of "+" signs.
## [SortTime](SortTime) - Takes a number from input and grabs that many words from the [text file](manywords100k.txt). Program then sorts those words alphebetically and prints how long it took. Includes an [Excel spreadsheet](Java%20Results.xlsx") with a graph for various numbers and the time it took.
